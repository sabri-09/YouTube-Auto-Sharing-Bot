# YouTube Auto Sharing Bot

This project automates sharing YouTube videos to social channels like **Facebook**, **Twitter (X)**, and **Reddit** directly from Android devices and emulators. It removes copy-paste fatigue, enforces consistent captions/hashtags, and scales distribution across multiple accounts and devices with human-like pacing. The **YouTube Auto Sharing Bot** helps creators and teams boost reach, cut posting time, and keep brand messaging uniform.

## Introduction

**What it does:** Automates end-to-end sharing of YouTube videos (links or shorts) to Facebook pages/groups, Twitter timelines, and Reddit subreddits from Android.

**Problem it solves:** Manual cross-posting is repetitive, error-prone, and slowâ€”especially with multiple brands or regional accounts.

**Benefit:** Consistent, scheduled distribution with tracking, retries, and parallel device execution for 10â€“1000+ posts per hour (policy-safe pacing).

### Automating Cross-Platform YouTube Video Sharing
- Templates for captions, tags, and UTM parameters keep messaging consistent across platforms.
- Runs on **real devices** or emulators with **non-ADB wireless control** for stealth and stability.
- Built-in scheduler, queues, and per-platform limits to respect rate caps and community rules.
- Central dashboard shows success/fail, retries, and proof logs with screenshots.

## Core Features 

- **Real Devices and Emulators:** Works with physical Android phones and popular emulators (Bluestacks/Nox). Attach one or hundreds; tasks are queued and balanced automatically.
- **No-ADB Wireless Automation:** Appilotâ€™s non-ADB channel controls UI without persistent USB/ADB; fewer disconnects, lower detection surface, and easier rack deployment.
- **Mimicking Human Behavior:** Randomized delays, scroll variance, typing jitter, and UI path variation to resemble natural posting flows on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.
- **Multiple Accounts Support:** Manage many brand or regional accounts per platform with safe rotations, cool-downs, and per-account posting caps.
- **Multi-Device Integration:** Run tasks in parallel across device farms; dynamic sharding ensures high throughput with fair scheduling and back-pressure.
- **Exponential Growth for Your Account:** Faster cross-network distribution increases surface area for discovery, boosting link clicks and watch sessions.
- **Premium Support:** Priority onboarding, playbooks for each platform, and rapid incident response with log-based diagnostics.
- **Task Scheduler & Queues:** Cron-like schedules, recurring campaigns, and FIFO/LIFO queues with per-platform concurrency controls.
- **Proxy & Fingerprint Compatibility:** Optional per-device proxies and browser stack settings for hybrid flows (e.g., OAuth handoffs, link previews).
- **Audit Logs & Webhooks:** Structured JSON logs, screenshot evidence, and webhooks to Slack/Discord for success/failure alerts.

### Additional Features
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Caption Templates & Spintax** | Compose reusable captions with variables (title, shortlink, hashtags) and spintax to reduce repetition. |
| **Link Shortening & UTM** | Auto-shorten video URLs and append UTM parameters for campaign/source tracking. |
| **Per-Platform Rules Engine** | Enforce subreddit flairs, Twitter char limits, and Facebook page/group selection with guardrails. |
| **Retry & Backoff** | Exponential backoff for transient errors; smart requeue with root-cause codes (captcha, rate-limit, network). |
| **Secrets & Vault** | Encrypted storage for credentials/tokens; device-scoped secrets with rotation policies. |
| **Reporting & Exports** | CSV/JSON exports of post results, timestamps, accounts, and device IDs for BI pipelines. |


## How It Works 

1. **Input or Trigger** â€” From the Appilot dashboard, select the YouTube video (URL/ID), choose target channels (Facebook pages/groups, Twitter accounts, Reddit subs), set captions/templates, and schedule or run now.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot drives Android devices/emulators via **UI Automator** or **non-ADB wireless control**, opening apps, navigating to compose screens, pasting templated captions, attaching thumbnails (optional), and submitting posts.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” Posts are published across selected platforms; the system captures permalinks (where possible), screenshots, and result codes, and can trigger webhooks or follow-up tasks.  
4. **Other functionalities** â€” Built-in retries, error tagging, structured logging, and parallel processing across a device pool ensure stable throughput and traceability.

## Use Cases 

- **Creators & Agencies** use it to auto-share every new YouTube upload to FB/Twitter/Reddit, so they can maximize reach without manual posting.  
- **Brands with Regional Accounts** use it to push localized captions across multiple profiles, so they can keep messaging consistent and on-time.  
- **Community Managers** use it to schedule Reddit announcement posts with correct flairs, so they can meet subreddit rules reliably.  
- **Newsrooms** use it to syndicate shorts to multiple social handles quickly, so they can hit trending windows.  

## FAQs

**How do I configure this automation for multiple accounts?**  
Define accounts in `config/accounts.yaml` with per-platform credentials and assign them to campaigns. The scheduler rotates accounts with safe cool-downs and caps.

**Does it support proxy rotation or anti-detection?**  
Yesâ€”set device- or account-level proxies in `settings.yaml`. Fingerprint and network settings are applied per device; hybrid browser handoffs are supported where needed.

**Can I schedule it to run periodically?**  
Absolutely. Use `campaigns.yaml` to define cron-like schedules per platform, with per-account posting limits and time-of-day windows.

**What about subreddit rules and flairs?**  
The rules engine validates character limits, required flairs, and NSFW flags before posting, failing fast with actionable error codes.

**Can it attach thumbnails or use shortened links?**  
Yesâ€”upload local thumbnails where supported and auto-shorten URLs with UTM tagging for analytics.

## Performance & Reliability Benchmarks

- **Execution Speed:** Typical end-to-end post in 18â€“35s per platform per device (including app launch, compose, and confirmation) under normal network conditions.  
- **Success Rate:** **95%** successful posts across platforms in steady-state runs with retry/backoff enabled.  
- **Scalability:** Horizontally scales from a single phone to **300â€“1000** devices with queue-based sharding and per-device concurrency control.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Lightweight workers (~150â€“250MB RAM per device agent); CPU bounded primarily by emulator density and screenshot capture.  
- **Error Handling:** Structured error taxonomy (rate-limit, captcha, network, auth); exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and automatic requeue; screenshot + log bundles for every failure.
